Read and write FASTA format.

oldowan.fasta is a small bioinformatic utility to read and write sequence data
in the FASTA_ format. FASTA is the most commonly used simple file format for
storing multiple DNA, RNA, or protein sequences in a single file. It is a
text-based, human-readable format.

Installation Instructions
=========================

This package is pure Python and has no dependencies outside of the standard
library. The easist way to install is using ``easy_install`` from the
setuptools_ package.  This usually goes something like this::

	$ easy_install oldowan.fasta

or on a unix-like system, assuming you are installing to the main Python
``site-packages`` directory as a non-privileged user, this::

	$ sudo easy_install oldowan.fasta

You may also use the standard python distutils setup method. Download the
current source archive from the file list towards the bottom of this page,
unarchive it, and install. On Mac OS X and many other unix-like systems, having
downloaded the archive and changed to the directory containing this archive in
your shell, this might go something like::

	$ tar xvzf oldowan.fasta*
	$ cd oldowan.fasta*
	$ python setup.py install

Quick Start
===========

oldowan.fasta has an interface based on the standard Python ``file``.  Import
oldowan.fasta::

  >>> from oldowan.fasta import fasta

Read a FASTA format file::

  >>> for entry in fasta('sequences.fasta', 'r'):
  ...     print entry['name'], len(entry['sequence'])

A more cumbersome, but equivalent way of doing the above::

  >>> fasta_file = fasta('sequences.fasta', 'r')
  >>> for entry in fasta_file:
  ...     print entry['name'], len(entry['sequence'])
  >>> fasta_file.close()

Even more cumbersome, and if the FASTA file is large, potentially
memory-draining version (the previous two methods only read one entry at a time
from the file, this reads the whole file into memory at once)::

  >>> fasta_file = fasta('sequence.fasta', 'r')
  >>> entries = fasta_file.readentries()
  >>> fasta_file.close()
  >>> for entry in entries:
  ...     print entry['name'], len(entry['sequence'])

Read a string of FASTA format sequences::

  >>> fasta_string = open('sequences.fasta', 'r').read()
  >>> for entry in fasta(fasta_string, 's'):
  ...     print entry['name'], len(entry['sequence'])

Read a file object::

  >>> fasta_file = open('sequences.fasta', 'r')
  >>> for entry in fasta(fasta_file, 'f'):
  ...     print entry['name'], len(entry['sequence'])

Write to a file::

  >>> fasta_file = open('sequences.fasta', 'w')
  >>> fasta_file.write({'name':'Sequence1', 'sequence':'AGCTAGCT'})
  >>> fasta_file.close()
